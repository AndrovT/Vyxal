# Parser / Structure Grouper
_First revision - horribly cursed and probably incorrect. Please take with a pinch of salt for the moment_

The parser is what takes the tokens generated by the lexer and groups them into corresponding structures. Structures are elements made of sub-elements grouped
together. Structures can have branches that impact either a) the attributes of the structure or b) how the structure is executed. Branches are created by using `|`.

The components of a structure are represented through python dictionaries. The keys represent the different branches. For example, an if-statement might be represented
as so:

```python
{
  "truthy-branch": [...tokens...],
  "falsey-branch": [...tokens...]
}
```

Each structure has the following: a _default_ branch (the branch that is used if no other branches are included), a _starting_ branch (the branch that is initally
written to), an _active_ branch (the branch that is currently being written to) and a branch list (that indicates the pattern of the branches). Here, "written to" means that tokens are being appended to that branch.

Upon reaching a `|`, the active branch is set to the next branch in the branch list for the structure.

| Structure    | Default Branch | Starting Branch | Branch List     |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| If statement | Truthy         | Truthy          | Truthy, Falsey  |
| For loop     | Body           | Body            | Name, Body      |
| While loop   | Body           | Body            | Condition, Body |
| Function     | Name           | Name            | Name, Body      |
| Lambda       | Body           | Body            | Arity, Body     |
